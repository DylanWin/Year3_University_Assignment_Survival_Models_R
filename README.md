Assignment 1 (Kaplan Meier and Cox Regression Model):

->   Determine which drug (Drug A or Drug B) has higher effectiveness in prolonging life of patients with particular critical illness with random generated data of 200 patients (time of survival and boolean censored survival time, with 100 patients taking Drug A and another with 100 Drug B) using Kaplan Meier Model and Cox Regression Model

->Also:

i)   Determine probability of patient taking Drug A survive for more than 2.3 years

ii)  Determine probability of patient taking Drug B survive for less than/equal to 3.1 years

iii) Determine the constant estimate (beta_hat) that best describes mortality rate (rate of death) relationship between those taking Drug A and Drug B, also prove the validity of the assumed constant estimated value.
